# Rebel's Advocate

The Rebel's Advocate is my little personal place where I can share my thoughts with the world on a vast variety of topics, from sports to politics; from psychology to technology; from true crime to music. It is where I explore topics outside of my everyday career path as I tend to focus a lot on coding and entrepreneurship.

Rebel's Advocate is the name of this project because I like to advocate for viewpoints that are outside of your normal commentary on many topics. Many people don't think for themselves anymore these days and get sucked into a 24/7 news cycle that is filled with propaganda, fear, xenophobia, racism, and hate. I take an honest and educated approach to discussing many topics that we face in our modern world.

I hope you enjoy my blog and feel free to contribute in any way!
