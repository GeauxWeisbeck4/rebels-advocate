description: Telling you how I got to this point in my life is important.
---

If you were to meet me today, you may not think much of me. I wouldn't blame you - well yes I would, because you are part of the problem. I suppose what I mean is I would expect you to not think much of me like many people I encounter on a daily basis.

That is because I am currently living in a tent, I make my money by panhandling, and I haven't showered in over a week. Does this sound like somebody who has a college education, spends as much of their free time as they can coding, or somebody who writes this blog? Maybe it's not what you would expect, but it is the truth.

You probably want to know how a college educated programmer ended up homeless with no job, panhandling on a daily basis to survive. Some of it has to do with the way my life has gone, but I'd like to point out that society makes it extremely hard (if not impossible) for a person to climb out of the situation that I find myself in now.

## How I Ended Up Homeless

There is a lot to cover here, so I will start with the direct line of events that caused me and the love of my life to end up on the street, living in a tent and struggling to survive. Then I'll circle back to major events in my life that shaped the foundation for my current homeless situation.

### Losing a Great Job

So all of this started back in 2022 - actually, let's start in November of 2021. I was working a really good job as a SOC Analyst for a Cybersecurity company. I also was on probation for a DUI that I got a year earlier unfortunately, as North Carolina is quite harsh on drunk drivers. My probation officer changed randomly one day and my new officer decided to drug test me - I failed, but it was for a prescription that I had.

I made the mistake of letting my work know the truth, because I value honesty and wanted to be transparent with what was going on since I had to go to court the next week for failing the drug test. They told me it would all be fine since I was telling them the truth. They lied. I was fired for "being a risk to the organization due to my mental health and drug addiction".

What really sucked is that the probation officer decided to not even pursue any charges after I told her I lost my job due to the failed drug test - and she even decided to let me off probation. So I lost my great job for no real reason at all, and even worse, I have not been able to find gainful employment since then. Nearly three fucking years of unemployment people, and it's not for a lack of learning new skills or trying.

### Kicked to the Curb - Twice

What does losing my job have to do with all this? Well obviously, my fiance and I lost a large portion of our income which made it hard to afford rent - which actually should not have been a problem at the time because we had rental support through a company called Telamon. Telamon signed a contract that they would pay our rent for 15 months, starting in June of 2020 and ending in October of 2021.

We had a hard time getting them to pay our first few months of rent, but we were able to get that worked out. This should have foreshadowed what would happen, but we were told that we shouldn't worry about rent because it would be covered by the rental assistance. Well lo and behold, Telamon decided to not pay our rent after January of 2022 and terminated the program when they mysteriously ran out of funds in May of 2022. So we had to figure out how to pay January through May with just Lisa's income of her full-time outreach worker job.

This caused us to receive our first eviction notice. Wasn't fair, but we figured out how to get into another apartment ASAP and avoided going to the streets for the time being. Problem with that was our rent was now at about $1,500 a month, about $500 more than our previous rent and this was still on one salary as I struggled to find work.

I continued to grow my web developer skill set and applied for thousands of jobs over the last few years. But the tech industry layoffs combined with a stressful home life and other issues caused me to struggle finding any kind of work - I even was turned down from grocery stores all the way to Walmart. I just could not find a second source of income to help pay our rent.

Well we had gotten behind on rent and after going to court, found out that we owed our apartment $3,500. They somehow managed to fudge that number up to $6,350 and we had to pay it by the end of December of 2022 or we would be evicted.

A miracle happened and I got a freelance gig where I would make $6,500 - enough to pay our rent. I complete the job and am paid in time to avoid our eviction - or so I thought. The apartment complex somehow figured out how they could raise that figure to $6,750 - just $250 more than what we had so they could make sure that they could evict us from their building.

There's a lot more to this story that I will get into another time, but basically we were thrown to the street and lost about half of our possessions as we moved into a hotel for the next month.

### Things Continue to Digress

So we couldn't afford the hotel forever and I continued to struggle with finding work. However, we do a good thing and take a good bit of our money and buy an old Jeep from somebody off Craigslist... and it turns out to not be such a good thing.

The first sign of something being wrong was the flat tire when we drove off. But we fixed it and made due with the Jeep for a while, before finding out that the Title was not the original and the owner had disappeared. We were working on remedying this situation when on one of the worst nights of my life, the right front jeep tire blew out. At this point, we pull over and go to see what we can do about our Jeep since we have no money.
In the worst moment of the whole night, my cat Beaux jumped over me, out the car, and ran off down the ditch on the side of the road, never to be seen again. He was my sweetheart kitty that I had fallen in love with since I got him as a little guy and this absolutely crushed me and Lisa. To make matters worse, we had let our other cat Zubi run off to play somewhere earlier in the day and we now had no way of going to pick her up. We also never saw Zubi again either, and we will never see our two beloved cats ever again.

One good thing about the Jeep is that we always had a place to stay that we could warm up and feel relatively safe sleeping in. Well, about a week after blowing out the Jeep tire, Lisa and I bought a new tire after she got paid and went to go pop that bad boy back on our Jeep. The only thing was that the Jeep was no longer in the little grassy area way off the road where we had moved it to avoid being towed. Somebody had stolen it and all of our entire life belongings that were in the Jeep - which included the majority of my book collection, which had books I had gotten throughout my whole life and valued over anything else I owned.

### And It Still Gets Worse

Ok, that is a lot to take in, but you as the reader need to understand the level of pain that we have endured the last couple years. Let me run through the next series of events real quick for you:

- Lisa loses her job and we leave Raleigh for Chapel Hill
- We end up on the Durham-Chapel Hill line sleeping on the ground of the Home Depot Parking Lot for a month until we can afford a tent
- We get heat stroke and my laptop, glasses, our phone, and other belongings are stolen when we get heat exhaustion and the ambulance takes us to the hospital
- We lose my dog Magnolia

## To Be Continued

These are just a few of the tragic events we faced, but they should give you an idea of the general path we've taken to our current existence as tent-dwellers. Since this is such a long post, I don't want to bore my readers or tire your eyes out.

I will continue with my story in Part Two of Andrew's Story where I will also go back further in time to some other traumatic events that have brought us here to this point in time. Thank you for reading!
