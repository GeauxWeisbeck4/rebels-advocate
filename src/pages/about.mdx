            **The Rebel's Advocate** is a blog by Andrew Weisbeck that explores a wide range of topics from current issues to sports to psychology. Whatever is on Andrew's mind, you can be sure he has a lot to say about it - and you can expect a unique opinion that strays from your everyday mainstream perspectives. We become rebels when we decide we've had enough bullshit from the establishments that make decisions for us everyday and we take action to take our own lives into our own hands.


        Sadly, so many people can't handle the discomfort of critical thinking and honest self evaluation. We have become reliant on corporations, governments, and other entities to provide everything in our lives from everything we eat all the way to the information we consume. We have become a society that values comfort so much that we allow ourselves to become slaves to a select few powerful and greedy groups of wealthy individuals who decide how our world operates.

        The intention of the Rebel's Advocate is to make you think differently about something - or even just to entertain you! Andrew thanks you for stopping by and checking out this blog and encourages you to engage in the change that you want to see in the world.
